# 1st expereince 

Writing about how I created a website, checked asthetcis multiple websites then decided to go from scratch
usng react js learning form geeksforgeeks
installed npm and understand what is npm and react 

npm is a tool that helps us create website 
before we used to use javascript and now we have react which is a next level js library for buolding front end applications and in my case a website. This was created by Facebook imagine. I am doing this for myself so I wntd to add a small expereince faceook came around when I was in 7th grade and we all went to the internet cafe tp create oyr acconunts we used to all call from our ladnlines to be online at 5pm and go to the cafes and be online. What simpler times. 

As I am navagitating the website I am writing this first blog which is a super great expereince. I aim to be nostalgic, learn and try to do this for myself. If you enjoy reading it plwase do let me know becuase it would make me feel elated :P

React has compinent based structure and virtual doms to give us a seamless user experience. Lers understand what does componet based struture even mean. It means we can build a ui with reuable peices which improves scalability and reusibility. It helps us to east to debug because of one way data binding. React updates only changed parts of the DOM which helps in fast rendering. Document Object Model, is a programming interface that represents a web page's structure as a tree of objects, allowing languages like JavaScript to dynamically change a page's content, structure, and style.

React creates a virtual DOM which is a lihtweight  copy of the actua DOM. It helps to cchange only the components that have been added or deleted. We can code using HTML which is called JSX which hlps to write wiythin JavaScript. HElps us debug easily. 

I am following multiple blogs and youtube tutorials and the react documentation.  So for a beginner first install node js from the internet install it and then researt your vs code 

once hat is done npx create-react-app website
cd website
